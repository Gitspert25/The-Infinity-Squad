### User Papers

The **User Papers** folder is where each squad member can introduce themselves to the community. Itâ€™s like your official Infinity Squad space passport!

#### What is a User Paper?

A User Paper is a JSON file that contains your basic profile info. This helps everyone know whoâ€™s part of the squad, what skills and interests you have, and any special message you'd like to share.

#### Why User Papers?

- To build a strong, diverse, and friendly community  
- To showcase our membersâ€™ skills and passions  
- To make it easy for members to connect and collaborate

#### How to Create Your User Paper

1. **Go into the `User Papers` folder in this repository.**
